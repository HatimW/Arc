# Sevenn

Sevenn is an offline-first study app for organizing diseases, drugs, and concepts.
This repository hosts the SPA implementation using vanilla JavaScript modules.

## Features

- Runs completely offline; open `index.html` to get started.
- Token-based global search filters items in browse views.
- Study builder and sessions for flashcards, quizzes, and review.
- Export and import data, including Anki CSV.

## Development

To run the optional test suite or future tooling, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run tests with:

```bash
npm test
```

To use the app, simply open `index.html` directly in a modern browserâ€”no build step
or local server is required.

The **Settings** tab lets you adjust the daily review target and manage curriculum
blocks with their lectures. It also offers buttons to export or import the
database as JSON and to export an Anki-compatible CSV. Data is stored locally
using IndexedDB.

Browse views include a global search box in the header to filter items by
matching text tokens.

## Roadmap

See the implementation blueprint in the repository for planned modules and features.

## Python prototype

An optional Python entry point is included for future backend experiments. It
spins up a very small Flask application that returns a greeting.

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start the development server:

```bash
python -m app.main
```

Then visit [http://localhost:5000/hello/world](http://localhost:5000/hello/world)
in your browser to verify the server responds with a JSON greeting.
